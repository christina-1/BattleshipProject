# BattleshipProject
Battleship project for Multimedia course

A version of the classic Battleship game where the user plays against the computer. The game ends if the all ships of one player have been shunk or if 40 shots have been made by each player.

Two dashboards are visible to the user: One showing the player's ships and the shots made by the computer and one showing the shots made by the player and the consequencies on the computer's ships. The ships are placed either horizontally or vertically and not diagonally. Each dashboard's cell can be taken by only one ship and each player has exactly 5 ships, one from each of the five categories described in the following chart.

| Ship's type | Number of cells | Points of shot | Shinking bonus |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Carrier     | 5               | 350            | 1000           |
| Battleship  | 4               | 250            | 500            |
| Cruiser | 3 | 100 | 250 |
| Submarine | 3 | 100 | 0|
| Destroyer | 2 | 50 | 0 |
